### 1. **Introduction**



This PRD outlines the requirements for a Mac OS application that provides real-time audio transcription, with transcription and text cleaning handled by AI agents. The application aims to deliver accurate and polished text output efficiently.



### 2. **Scope**



The application will utilize AI agents for transcription and text cleaning. In the first version, only the Google Gemini Flash 2.0 model will be supported. Future versions will include support for models from other providers and local models.



### 3. **AI Agents Definition**



- **Transcription Agent:** Responsible for converting spoken audio into written text using the Google Gemini Flash 2.0 model.



- **Text Cleaning Agent:** Handles the refinement of transcribed text by correcting errors, removing filler words, and smoothing out pauses, also using the Google Gemini Flash 2.0 model.



### 4. **Dependencies**



- The application relies on Google's API for the Gemini Flash 2.0 model for both transcription and text cleaning in the initial release.



### 5. **Functional Requirements**



- **Transcription Agent:**

 - Accuracy: Achieve at least 95% accuracy in transcription using Google Gemini Flash 2.0.

 - Latency: Transcribe audio with a delay of less than 2 seconds.



- **Text Cleaning Agent:**

 - Correct common speech errors and remove filler words using Google Gemini Flash 2.0.



### 6. **Future Enhancements**



- Support for models from other providers and local models will be added in future releases.



### 7. **Risks and Mitigation**



- **Dependency on External AI Services:** The app is initially dependent on Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 model. To mitigate risks, the architecture should be designed to accommodate future models with minimal changes.



### 8. **Assumptions**



- The application is built with flexibility to integrate additional AI models from different providers in future updates.



### 9. **Success Metrics**



- **Transcription Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of the transcription agent using Google Gemini Flash 2.0.

- **Error Correction Effectiveness:** Evaluate the performance of the text cleaning agent using Google Gemini Flash 2.0.

- **User Satisfaction:** Gather user feedback to assess satisfaction with the output quality.



### 10. *Tools to Use*



To develop the real-time audio transcription app for Mac OS, the following Mac OS related tools and frameworks are essential:



1. **Development Environment:**

  - **Xcode**: The primary IDE for Mac and iOS app development, providing a comprehensive suite of tools for building, testing, and debugging applications.



2. **User Interface:**

  - **SwiftUI**: A modern framework for building user interfaces, offering a declarative syntax and seamless integration with macOS.



3. **Audio Processing:**

  - **AVFoundation**: A framework for capturing and processing audio, essential for real-time audio input and transcription.



4. **Networking:**

  - **URLSession**: For making API calls to Google's Gemini Flash 2.0 model, handling network requests and responses.



5. **Global Hotkeys:**

  - **Cocoa Event Monitoring**: For implementing global shortcuts that allow users to start and stop transcription with a hotkey.



6. **Clipboard Integration:**

  - **NSPasteboard**: macOS's API for interacting with the system-wide clipboard, enabling the app to paste cleaned text into any active editor or input field.



7. **Testing and Profiling:**

  - **Xcode Testing Frameworks**: For unit and UI testing to ensure app reliability and functionality.

  - **Xcode Performance Tools**: For profiling and optimizing real-time processing performance.



8. **Dependency Management:**

  - **Swift Package Manager**: For managing external libraries and dependencies efficiently.



9. **Version Control:**

  - **Git**: For version control, with built-in support in Xcode for seamless integration.



10. **Security and Privacy:**

  - Ensure compliance with macOS privacy settings, particularly for microphone access.



These tools and frameworks will provide a robust foundation for developing a high-quality, efficient real-time audio transcription app on Mac OS.
